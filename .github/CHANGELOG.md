# Customizations Changelog

Tracks intentional changes to the engineering operating model: instructions,
skills, WAF docs, and MCP config. Git history captures *what*; this file
captures *why*. Newest first.

## 2026-08-13
- Add a root `AI_WORKLOG.md` template for concise, sanitized summaries of
  material AI-assisted project work, preserving request-to-outcome context
  without storing raw prompts or transcripts.
- Distinguish the project AI worklog from `.github/CHANGELOG.md` (operating
  model changes) and an optional root `CHANGELOG.md` (user-facing releases),
  removing ambiguity about where each kind of rationale belongs.
- Extend the operational-excellence guidance to make project-level AI work
  traceable while explicitly limiting documentation overhead and sensitive
  data exposure.
- Document the convention in the expanded documentation-branch README while
  keeping the main-branch README minimal for template consumers.

## 2026-07-31
- Promote `AGENTS.md` as the canonical cross-platform AI operating model so
  Codex and other agents can discover the repository guidance without relying
  on GitHub Copilot-specific file names.
- Convert `.github/copilot-instructions.md` into a Copilot adapter and add
  lightweight Claude/Cursor adapters that point back to the shared rules,
  reducing duplicated instruction drift across AI platforms.
- Document the preferred reuse model: use this repository as a template by
  default, and only use a submodule with root-level adapter files in the
  consuming project.

## 2026-07-24
- Move the hand-maintained WAF reference material into
  `.github/ai-reference/waf/` so pkgdown clean builds can safely replace the
  generated `docs/` website without deleting AI guidance.

## 2026-06-29
- Update R guidance: treat `renv` as suggested (not required), prefer
  explicit non-base namespacing, and favor `purrr` iteration patterns over
  `for` loops by default.
- Standardize Python guidance on the Astral `uv` workflow (`uv lock`,
  `uv sync`, `uv run`) across base, analysis, and reliability references.
- Add PostgreSQL instruction set (`.github/instructions/postgresql.instructions.md`)
  with MCP-first workflow guidance (context -> query -> modify), safety checks,
  and performance review expectations.
- Update README with a dedicated PostgreSQL section so users discover MCP-first
  DB workflow guidance from the template landing page.
- Add a PostgreSQL MCP quick-start checklist in README for faster onboarding to
  safe DB workflows.

## 2026-06-29
- Initial scaffold: lightweight `copilot-instructions.md` (think-then-code
  with inline WAF awareness, no spec/plan gates), R/Python/analysis style
  instructions, `well-architected` instruction, WAF pillar checklists.
  Forked from the spec-driven template — omits `/spec`, `/plan` prompts and
  `Architect`/`Planner` agents by design. Use when formal spec overhead is not
  warranted (exploratory work, solo projects, known domains).
